# Spring Boot Lifecycle presentation

These slides are intended to be used with the demo code from the [spring-boot-lifecycle-demo](https://github.com/perpostor/spring-boot-lifecycle-demo) repository. The goal is to demonstrate everything that happens when you start a simple Web Spring Boot app and the different lifecycle stages that Spring Boot goes through.
